            <h1>How people see me </h1>
            <p>The Hulk is a towering, green-skinned behemoth known for his immense strength and uncontrollable rage. Seen as both a fearsome force of destruction and a tragic figure, the Hulk's alter ego is Dr. Bruce Banner. When Banner loses control over his emotions, particularly his anger, he transforms into the Hulk.</p>
            <p>People perceive the Hulk as a symbol of raw power and unbridled chaos. His sheer size and physical might make him an unstoppable force, capable of smashing through obstacles and enemies with ease. However, his lack of control and unpredictability often lead to collateral damage and chaos.
            </p>
            <p>Despite his intimidating appearance, there's a sense of tragedy surrounding the Hulk. Many see him as a tortured soul, struggling to control the fury within him. The constant battle between Banner's intellect and the Hulk's brute force reflects the duality of his nature.
            <p>In the eyes of many, the Hulk is a complex and fascinating character – a reminder of the fine line between power and vulnerability, and the struggles that come with being both a hero and a monster.
