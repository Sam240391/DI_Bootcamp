# üåü Exercise 1: Cats
# Instructions
# Using this class

# class Cat:
#     def __init__(self, cat_name, cat_age):
#         self.name = cat_name
#         self.age = cat_age
# Instantiate three Cat objects using the code provided above.
# Outside of the class, create a function that finds the oldest cat and returns the cat.
# Print the following string: ‚ÄúThe oldest cat is <cat_name>, and is <cat_age> years old.‚Äù. Use the function previously created.




# class Cat:
#     def __init__(self, cat_name, cat_age):
#         self.name = cat_name
#         self.age = cat_age



# cat1 = Cat('kitty', 4)
# cat2 = Cat('jumy', 2)
# cat3 = Cat('baby', 7)




# def find_oldest_cat():
#     cats = [cat1, cat2, cat3]
#     oldest_cat = cats[0]
#     for cat in cats:
#         if cat.age > oldest_cat.age:
#             oldest_cat = cat
#     return oldest_cat


# oldest_cat = find_oldest_cat()
        
# print(f"The oldest cat is {oldest_cat.name}, and is {oldest_cat.age} years old.")



# üåü Exercise 2 : Dogs
# Instructions
# Create a class called Dog.
# In this class, create an __init__ method that takes two parameters : name and height. This function instantiates two attributes, which values are the parameters.
# Create a method called bark that prints the following string ‚Äú<dog_name> goes woof!‚Äù.
# Create a method called jump that prints the following string ‚Äú<dog_name> jumps <x> cm high!‚Äù. x is the height*2.
# Outside of the class, create an object called davids_dog. His dog‚Äôs name is ‚ÄúRex‚Äù and his height is 50cm.
# Print the details of his dog (ie. name and height) and call the methods bark and jump.
# Create an object called sarahs_dog. Her dog‚Äôs name is ‚ÄúTeacup‚Äù and his height is 20cm.
# Print the details of her dog (ie. name and height) and call the methods bark and jump.
# Create an if statement outside of the class to check which dog is bigger. Print the name of the bigger dog.


# class dog:
#     def __init__(self, dog_name, dog_height):
#         self.name = dog_name
#         self.height = dog_height

#     def bark(self):
#         print(f'{self.name} goes woof')


#     def jump(self):
#         x = self.height * 2
#         print(f'{self.name} jumps {x} cm high')



# davids_dog = dog('rex', 50)

# print(f'David"s dog name is {davids_dog.name} and his height is {davids_dog.height} cm')

# davids_dog.bark()
# davids_dog.jump()


# sarahs_dog = dog('Teacup', 20)

# print(f'Sarah"s dog name is {sarahs_dog.name} and his height is {sarahs_dog.height} cm')

# sarahs_dog.bark()
# sarahs_dog.jump()


# def bigger_dog():
#     dogs=[davids_dog, sarahs_dog]
#     bigger_dog = dogs[0]
#     for dog in dogs:
#        if dog.height > bigger_dog.height:
#         bigger_dog = dog 
#     return bigger_dog

# bigg_dog = bigger_dog()

# print(f'the bigger dog is {bigg_dog.name} he"s {bigg_dog.height} cm')




# üåü Exercise 3 : Who‚Äôs The Song Producer?
# Instructions
# Define a class called Song, it will show the lyrics of a song.
# Its __init__() method should have two arguments: self and lyrics (a list).
# Inside your class create a method called sing_me_a_song that prints each element of lyrics on its own line.
# Create an object, for example:

# stairway= Song(["There‚Äôs a lady who's sure","all that glitters is gold", "and she‚Äôs buying a stairway to heaven"])


# Then, call the sing_me_a_song method. The output should be:

# There‚Äôs a lady who's sure
# all that glitters is gold
# and she‚Äôs buying a stairway to heaven


# class song:
#     def __init__(self, lyrics):
#         self.lyrics = lyrics

#     def sing_me_a_song(self):
#         for element in self.lyrics:
#          print(f'{element}')


# my_fav_song = song(['Hey jude, don"be afraid,', 'don"be afraid'])

# my_fav_song.sing_me_a_song()


# stairway= song(["There's a lady who's sure","all that glitters is gold", "and she's buying a stairway to heaven"])

# stairway.sing_me_a_song()



# Exercise 4 : Afternoon At The Zoo
# Instructions
# Create a class called Zoo.
# In this class create a method __init__ that takes one parameter: zoo_name.
# It instantiates two attributes: animals (an empty list) and name (name of the zoo).
# Create a method called add_animal that takes one parameter new_animal. This method adds the new_animal to the animals list as long as it isn‚Äôt already in the list.
# Create a method called get_animals that prints all the animals of the zoo.
# Create a method called sell_animal that takes one parameter animal_sold. This method removes the animal from the list and of course the animal needs to exist in the list.
# Create a method called sort_animals that sorts the animals alphabetically and groups them together based on their first letter.
# Example

# { 
#     1: "Ape",
#     2: ["Baboon", "Bear"],
#     3: ['Cat', 'Cougar'],
#     4: ['Eel', 'Emu']
# }


# Create a method called get_groups that prints the animal/animals inside each group.

# Create an object called ramat_gan_safari and call all the methods.
# Tip: The zookeeper is the one who will use this class.
# Example
# Which animal should we add to the zoo --> Giraffe
# x.add_animal(Giraffe)
