# ðŸŒŸ Exercise 1: Task Scheduler
# Instructions
# Write a Python program that simulates a task scheduler using a queue. The program should:

# Add a task to the queue with a description and priority level.
# Execute the next task based on its priority (First-In-First-Out if priority levels are the same).
# Show the current task queue.
# Use Pythonâ€™s collections.deque for the queue implementation.



# Example:
# Add task: "Clean room", priority: 2
# Add task: "Do homework", priority: 1
# Execute next task -> Output: Executing task: Do homework
# Show task queue -> Output: Task Queue: [("Clean room", 2)]
