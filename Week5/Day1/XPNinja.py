# def factorial(n):
#     print(f"Calling factorial({n})")  # This line will help in debugging
#     if n == 0:  # Base Case
#         return 1
#     else:       # Recursive Case
#         return n * factorial(n - 1)
    

# print(factorial(5))

# 5 x 4 x 3 x 2

# 5!

# Questions:

# How many times was the factorial function called?

# 6 Times

# Describe the changes in the variable n throughout the execution.

# The variable n is increase to 1 each time that the functiun is calling and when n = 0 we arrive to the base case

# At what point did the function hit the base case?

# when n = 0 we arrive to the base case

# What happens to the call stack when the function hits the base case?

#  When the function hit the base case it's returning to 1 and  so factorial(0) = 1 and n * 1 = 120
